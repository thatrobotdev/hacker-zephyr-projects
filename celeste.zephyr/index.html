        <h3>Really amazing music!</h3>
        <p>The music in Celeste is more than just background music. It amplifies the emotions you feel in the game. For example, in anxious parts the music is tense, and in calm parts the music keeps you at rest. Beyond that, the music subtly notes at progression in the game.</p>
        <p>It's composed by the same person that made the Pigstep disc in Minecraft, named Lena Raine. Their work for Celeste is very techno, with "pixely" sounds that mesh with the artstyle in the game.</p>
        <p>Below are pictures of album art from the game, as well as a remix by another composer making a version of the music for relaxing.</p>

        <p>These are also avaliable in /opt/community/music. All the files are .m4a files, which mean they are higher quality than regular compressed mp3 files, but they aren't playable on all platforms. They are compatible with iTunes and VLC Media player, and you can convert to mp3 using ffmpeg or online conversion websites.</p>

        <h3>Really amazing art!</h3>
        <p>The game was originally created on PICO-8, a retro game system with intentional limitations to produce pixel games and chiptune sounds. When it was re-created in its current form, Celeste kept the pixel art theme and chiptune music, but it riffs on this theme with a spectacular mix of pixel art, high quality art, and 3D settings. This balance is seamless, and all of the different elements mesh together for a beautiful composition.</p>

        <h3>Really amazing story</h3>
        <p>In Celeste you follow Madeline, in a journey to find herself, and a journey to climb Celeste Mountain. Madeline suffers from anxiety, and on her journey she learns more about herself and how to coexist with all parts of herself. Along her personal journey, she meets a cast of characters with their own motivations and problems to solve, and you make a few friends along the way.</p>
