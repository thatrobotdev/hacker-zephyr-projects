# hacker-zephyr

This summer, I had the pleasure of being invited to the [Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com/). The Hacker Zephyr was an intiative of the nonprofit [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), where I lead a chapter with a network of programming clubs across the world.

In a chartered train across America, we started at [Hack Club HQ](https://goo.gl/maps/jNQB5kwYoLH11JqM6) in Burlington, Vermont, headed south to New York City, west through Chicago, crossed the Rockies on our way to San Fransisco, then we followed the Pacific Ocean and ended in Los Angeles. It was the world's longest hackathon on land: 3,502 miles long.

It was an unforgettable trip, where the hackathon theme was to create a timecapsule of our experiences together. In this repository, I have collected my hackathon projects, finished and unfinished, to memorialize my experience on the trip. 

Beware the most terrible CSS stylesheets you've ever seen, broken links, and code focused on output instead of style or care. This hackathon spawned a bunch of tiny, hacked-together projects, and it was a lot of fun!

Originally, these websites were hosted on a custom local internet on the train, using the *.zephyr TLD, but most links in the sites are now broken.

There has been some copyrighted content removed so I can host under the current [LICENCE](LICENSE.md). I've also removed some personal information.

Thank you to everyone onboard who made this trip unforgettable, and to Hack Club HQ for providing the opporitunity of a lifetime.

## Project Directory (chronological order)

* [zephyr-contacts](contacts.zephyr/index.html) - Abadoned project that was going to be a contact sharing service for the train.
* [zephyr-contacts-beta](contacts-beta.zephyr/index.html) - Beta version of the site, where new features were tested.
* [online.zephyr](online.zephyr/index.html) - A website to let you know if the ZephyrNET (the name for the local intranet), was online.
* [zoogleff.zephyr](defaultsearch.zephyr/Zoogle Search Extension) - Over the course of the trip, there were around 5 separate search engines to search the local intranet created by other hackers. Google Chrome makes it really easy to change your default search engine to a custom choice, but Firefox requires you to use a Firefox add-on to change your default search engine. I made an add-on for searching as a default with Zoogle, one of the most popular search engines on the train. There were plans to support Roogle, another search engine, and [host a website that would tell you how to set these search engines as your browser defaults](defaultsearch.zephyr/index.html), but this was abandoned.
* [Roogle Search Extension](defaultsearch.zephyr/Roogle Search Extension) - A planned but never built firefox add-on to allow Roogle to be your default search engine
* [ilostmyphone.zephyr](ilostmyphone.zephyr/index.html) - During a portion of the trip where we were riding on a shared Amrtack train, I lost my phone somewhere on the train. It was around 2AM, so unfortunately many people were sleeping and I was unable to look very exhaustively to find my phone. In my frustration, I created a website to alert people to check their seats. The next morning, someone found my phone again, and all was right in the world!
* [ðŸš‚.zephyr](xn--358h.zephyr/index.html) - The first emoji URL on the train, utilizing punycode to deploy to a working URL.
* [trainemoji.zephyr](trainemoji.zephyr/index.html) - An alternate url for people with browsers that don't support emoji URLs, or can't type the emoji easily.
* [weather.zephyr](weather.zephyr) - An abandoned satirical weather site that would tell you that there isn't any weather on a train.
* [murderonthehacker.zephyr](murderonthehacker.zephyr) - An abandoned murder mystery called "The Murder on the Hacker Zephyr" written in the ink language. Intended to be exported and hosted, but the story was never finished.
* [jp.zephyr](jp.zephyr/index.html) - Acted as a personal site and link sharing area for my projects on the train.
* [celeste.zephyr](celeste.zephyr/index.html) - A site sharing music, art, and information for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/), a fun platforming game. A game download was removed from this archive.
* [info.zephyr](info.zephyr/index.html) - Abandoned site which would have shared information about the Zephyr, photographs, tickets, historical drawings, and other things from around the train.
* [domains.zephyr](domains.zephyr/index.html) - Abadoned domain-checking website. A parking feature was planned where you could find an unused domain and automatically reserve it.
* [thatrobotdev.zephyr](thatrobotdev.zephyr/index.html) - Automatic redirect from my screename to my personal website on the ZephyrNET.
* [antidisestablishmentarianism.zephyr](antidisestablishmentarianism.zephyr/index.html) - The (formerly) longest website name on the train. Includes a rambling paragraph of antidisestablishmentarianism values.
* [antidisestablishmentariancontrarianisisticvaluesareunsupportedhere.zephyr](antidisestablishmentariancontrarianisisticvaluesareunsupportedhere.zephyr/index.html) - Was going to be the longest site name to exist on the train, but I couldn't get this one to deploy properly. This redirects to [antidisestablishmentarianism.zephyr](antidisestablishmentarianism.zephyr/index.html).
* [puns.zephyr](puns.zephyr/index.html) - Pun sharing website that never took off, but I'm really proud of the one pun that exists on there.
