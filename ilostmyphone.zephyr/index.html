    <h2 id="update">UPDATE: I HAVE FOUND MY PHONE!!!!!!</h2>
    <p>THANK YOU SO MUCH TO [REMOVED NAME] FOR FINDING IT, YOU ARE LITERALLY THE BEST</p>
    <p>
        I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MISPLACED THINGS ON THIS TRAIN AS WELL, SO THESE
        AREAS TO CHECK ARE STILL RELEVANT. AS YOU DEPART THE TRAIN TODAY,
        MAKE SOMEONE'S DAY BY FINDING THEIR MISSING STUFF.
    </p>
    <p>THANK YOU ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³</p>
    <p>P.S. I WANT TO ADD SOME BACKRGOUND CONFETTI, BUT I FORGET HOW TO DO IT, SO HERE'S
        WHAT THE CONFETTI MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE IN CSS:</p>
        <code>body {background: url(confetti.gif);}</code>
    </p>

    <h1>I LOST MY PHONE ðŸ¥²</h1>
    <p>
        AT APPROXIMATELY 11:53PM LAST NIGHT, MY PHONE SENT THE LAST PING IT COULD
        TO THE APPLE SERVERS BEFORE IT DIED. DEVOID OF BATTERY, IT HAS BEEN SITTING
        IN AN UNKNOWN LOCATION ON THE TRAIN, LOST TO THE WORLD.
    </p>
    <p>
        IT IS A BLACK iPHONE 11, WITH A BROKEN POPSOCKET ON THE BACK (THE PLASTIC PART
        OF THE POP SOCKET HAS BROKEN OFF).
    </p>
    <h2>PLEASE CHECK:</h2>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox">YOUR FRONT SEAT POCKET</input><br>
        <input type="checkbox">THE GAPING VOID BEHIND YOUR SEAT</input><br>
        <input type="checkbox">UNDERNEATH YOUR FOOT REST THINGY</input><br>
        <input type="checkbox">BEHIND THE SEAT IN FRONT OF YOU</input><br>
    </div>
    <p>
        I WOULD BE FOREVER GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD HELP ME, AND I'LL UPDATE THIS
        SITE WHEN/IF THE PHONE IS FOUND.
    </p>
    <p>
        THANK YOU!!!!
        - JP
