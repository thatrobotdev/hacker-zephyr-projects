    <marquee direction="left">🌥️<b>WEATHER RIGHT NOW:</b>🌥️ I don't really know what the weather is like right now. This website isn't connected to a weather database, predicting weather, or even using temperature sensors. I don't know what I'm doing here writing this tickerline. I'm not even a meterologist. I don't know what I am talking about when it comes to weather, although I really like great weather, don't you? Great weather is the best weather of all. I'm glad we can agree. Maybe one day we'll both know the temperature outside, but for now we are in this together.</marquee>
